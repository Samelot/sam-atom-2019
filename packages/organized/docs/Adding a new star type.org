What do I need to change when I add a new startype ?  This seems to involve changing many moving parts:

1. Modify the grammar to recognize the new type so it can be colored.
2. Modify the regexes in Constant.coffee to recognize the new type
3. Modify star.newStarLine to construct the correct "next" line
4. Modify star._processLine to correctly emit the correct starType
5.
